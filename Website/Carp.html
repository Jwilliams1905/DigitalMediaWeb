    <p class="typography-carp">"these are my other two versions of the carp task. 
        version 1 (left) was my least favourite design, the contrast of the images is done but just feel it could be executed much better.
        version 2 (right) is much closer to the final design, it utilizes the idea of one core image and overall looks more clean and less cluttered. overall i am happy with, as it utilizes white space well and 
        i think its a good example of "carp" in use, this being said there were improvements to be made, which can be seen in the image on the homepage"</p>
