    <p class="typography">"the simplicity of the axial piece is my favourite part about it. 
        it uses a simple but effective black and white colour scheme and is easy to digest.
        however, this simplicity could also be its downfall, as it is not very advanced and 
        and could be chalked as too simplistic. overall i personally think simplicity helps express
        the disign and the style"</p>
