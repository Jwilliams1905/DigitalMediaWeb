        <P>"This is the image i chose as the main poster. I chose this one as in my opinion it is the most polished of the three
             and in some cases could genuinley pass as an official poster, 
            which is something the other two fall just short of. the overall idea i had was to have a single image background and lay the text over opposite sides (like above) with a transluscent background behind them to make the text pop a bit more than if they were just over the image."</P>

       <p>This website was originaly created last year (Digital media foundation, web design) by myself, but had no detailed css and relatively basic html, and didnt use much advanced css like classes or 
        transitions, focusing primarily on flexboxes and wrapping, as that was all that was required for the module. therefore most of the work done on the website was css work, like removing
        elements of items that served no purpose here (like javascript), and then changing the html to fit the images and doc files in where i needed them. the only aspects left the same were all to do with its structure, 
        so things like the nav bar (which actually did get altered), as well as the general flow of the website. 
        overall i think i did a good job building on what was there before, creating fresh pages like the typography and carp sheets, which included features that were never on the original page.</p>
